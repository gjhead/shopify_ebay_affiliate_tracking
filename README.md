Ebay Affiliates (Formerly Pepperjam) Tracking Code Implementation for Shopify

This is the Ebay Affiliates tracking code made to work in .liquid so that you can implement it in Shopify.

As of this writing, the documentation from EBAY can be found here:

Two items that are not included in this code (which are optional from the documentation) are:

CATEGORY: This cannot be pulled from the item through shopify.
NEW_TO_FILE: Still unable to test for this through Shopify.
